                <h3>Visa Information</h3>
<p>People from most countries will be able to enter Ireland without a Visa, but we recommend that you check <a href="http://dfa.ie/" target="_blank">dfa.ie</a> before your trip.</p>

                <h3>Dublin Bikes</h3>
<p>If you want to use <a href="http://www.dublinbikes.ie/" target="_blank">dublinbikes</a> you will have to sign up to their service. Since you are a visitor to Dublin we recommend the <a href="http://www.dublinbikes.ie/Subscription/The-3-Day-Ticket" target="_blank">3-Day Ticket</a>. These tickets are convenient, great value for money and can be purchased from any of the 15 credit card terminals for just €2. The first half-hour of use is free; after that a service charge applies.  You can buy a 3-Day Ticket at stations with credit card terminals. This facility is available at 15 station terminals (see <a href="http://www.dublinbikes.ie/Stations/View-stations/Dublinbikes-station-list" target="_blank">Station List</a> or download the <a href="http://www.dublinbikes.ie/content/download/26663/126031/version/2/file/110817_Dublin_bikemap_AW_cut+guide.pdf" target="_blank">Station Map <span>720KB PDF</span></a>). Consult the terminal menu to obtain a short-term ticket that you will need to keep throughout the period covered by your subscription. This card contains an ID which you will need to enter each time you hire a bike, in addition to a PIN selected by you. It is important that you keep your ticket in the event that any issue may arise.</p>

<h3>Dublin Bus</h3>
<p>Dublin Bus currently operates almost all commercial routes in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA). It is the main public transport provider for the GDA (extending as far as Newcastle in County Wicklow, Balbriggan in north County Dublin, Dunboyne in County Meath and Maynooth in County Kildare). Dublin Bus also provides many different services for tourists such as sightseeing tours and themed routes, for example the Dublin Ghost bus!</p>

<h3>Dart</h3>
<p>The DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit) is the rail line running along the coast of Dublin, from Malahide and Howth southwards as far as Greystones, Co Wicklow. The DART system is administered by the national rail operator, Iarnród Éireann (Irish Rail). You can connect to the regular train service for communities north of Dublin, right up to Belfast. The DART is most convenient if you are moving in or around the coastal areas.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.luas.ie/" target="_blank">Luas <span>www.luas.ie</span></a> <a href="http://www.luas.ie/interactive-map.html" target="_blank"><span>interaction map</span></a></h3>
<h4><a href="http://www.luas.ie/luas-red-line-stops/" target="_blank">The Red Line</a></h4>
<p>The Luas Red Line runs directly behind The CCD, conveniently linking to downtown Dublin and to Connolly and Heuston rail stations. Stops are provided at <a href="http://www.luas.ie/georges-dock.html" target="_blank">George&#8217;s Dock</a>, <a href="http://www.luas.ie/mayor-square-nci.html" target="_blank">Mayor Square</a>, and <a href="http://www.luas.ie/spencer-dock.html" target="_blank">Spencer Dock</a>.

                <h3>Art and Museums</h3>
<h4><a href="http://www.museum.ie/en/list/overview-arts-history.aspx" target="_blank">Collins Barracks &#8211; Museum of Decorative Arts &#038; History</a></h4>
<p>Originally an army barracks, the buildings were reopened in 1997 with a new purpose.

                <h3>Dublin Restaurant Guide</h3>
<p>Irish food is famous all over the world. From our strong agricultural foundations we’ve managed to build an industry of artisan level foods and luxury consumables. So what better way to enjoy the taste of Ireland than by patronizing some of our high level restaurants and eateries.</p>
<ul>

</li>
<li>
  <h4><a href="http://rusticstone.ie/" target="_blank">Rustic Stone</a>, South George&#8217;s Street</h4>
  <p>Rustic Stone’s philosophy is simple: tasty, nutritious, innovative cuisine that is accessible to all. bearing this in mind the restaurant is a fun, inviting and relaxed place to eat. By adopting an old Spanish technique, Customers are served their meat or fish dishes on a hot volcanic stone which they cook themselves. This method adds an element of theatre to the meal yet at the same time adds to customer preference allowing them to have their dish cooked exactly how they like it.</p>
</li>
<li>
  <h4><a href="http://www.alfies.ie/" target="_blank">Alfie&#8217;s</a>, 10 South William Street</h4>
  <p>Alfie&#8217;s in South William St is a hip, new restaurant. Located in the centre of Dublin, only a few steps from Grafton Street. They serve delicious Irish and international cuisine, alongside excellent wines and a fine choice of beers. Friendly, informative service, modern decor and a vibrant atmosphere will make your dining experience one to remember. Be sure to check out the upstairs bar!</p>

They pride themselves on excellent food at reasonable prices served in a relaxed atmosphere by very attentive staff.</p>
</li>
<li>
  <h4><a href="http://www.brasseriesixty6.com/" target="_blank">Brasserie Sixty6</a>, Great South Georges St.</h4>
  <p>Brasserie sixty6 aims is to bring an innovative accessible menu of the highest quality food and an expertly chosen wine list to their diners in funky, stylish surroundings, all at a reasonable cost to you. They take their food very very seriously. All food – everything – is cooked to order. A very solid choice.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Coffee + Tea Shops</h3>
<p>Large coffee-house chains like Starbucks and Costa Coffee are an obvious choice if you want something familiar and quick. If, however, you are like me, and you love real coffee then I’d recommend the following few places. They are all favourites of mine and often enjoy my patronage.</p>

<ul>
<li>
  <h4>3fE, The Twisted Pepper, Abbey St.</h4>
  <p>In preparation for his 2009 world barista championship bid, Colin built a bespoke training room in his Third Floor apartment, complete with a competition spec espresso machine. A friend of a friend named Trev dropped by one day to sample the coffee and was so impressed that he offered Colin a city centre space where he could recreate that same experience and bring life to a music venue that slept all day. In December 2009 Third Floor Espresso opened its doors in the lobby of the Twisted Pepper with one barista, a grinder and an espresso machine serving coffee roasted by Steve.</p>
  <p>Today it has expanded into the main bar and taken on three baristas; Ger, Pete and Jordan. It has also become the first shop in Europe to house an über boiler for the preparation of manual-brew filter coffees.</p>
  <p><strong>4 words: Very hip. Excellent coffee.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
  <h4>Busyfeet &#038; Coco Cafe, 41-42 South William Street</h4>
  <p>This bustling, quirky bohemian café emphasizes good, wholesome food. Organic ingredients play a prominent role on a menu that&#8217;s laden with delicious salads and sandwiches. It&#8217;s also one of the city center&#8217;s best-situated spots for a bit of people-watching, as Dublin&#8217;s young and hip stroll by all day long.</p>
</li>
<li>
  <h4>Cafe Leon, Wicklow Street</h4>
  <p>In the french tradition of the patisserie, Cafe Leon specializes in all manner of traditional french breads and baked goods. My personal favourite is their strong black filter coffee accompanied by their absolutely sumptuous chocolate fudge cake. A perfect hangout to spend an evening with good company in an indulgent and rich atmosphere.</p>
</li>
<li>
  <h4>Foam Cafe, 24 Strand Street Great</h4>
  <p>Upon entering the cafe, visitors are immediately at ease in its warm, comforting atmosphere. Foam Cafe is a refreshing relief compared to the modern and mundane interiors of today’s typical coffee shops. You’re encouraged to enjoy the kitsch decor and the very tasty food. All at very reasonable rates. Foam Cafe is an affront to cold minimalism with its cozy curious space.</p>
</li>
<li>
  <h4>Science Gallery Cafe, 191 Pearse Street</h4>
  <p>Open at Ireland’s leading research university, Trinity College Dublin, since February 2008, Science Gallery is a dynamic new model for public engagement with science, technology and innovation which has rapidly achieved significant international profile. Science Gallery Cafe resides within the gallery itself and serves as the perfect place to ruminate upon the exhibition. A place to relax and share ideas, engage and debate. All that AND perfect Italian style coffee.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pub Guide</h3>

<ul>
<li>
  <h4>4 Dame Lane, Dame Lane</h4>
  <p>4 Dame Lane can be difficult to find as it is tucked away in the alley leading from Georges Street to Andrew Street parallel to Dame Street but it is worth the hunt. Its a moody budy bar with a great party atmosphere. The district in which it rests is a very busy night life spot, with cool jazz often emanating from the neighboring establishments</p>
</li>
<li>
  <h4>Grogans’, 15 William St.</h4>
  <p>This is one of the best “Traditional Irish” pubs you’ll find in the City Centre. No music here, just the clink of glasses and the babble of chat. Art lines every wall, some of it from established artists, some of it from up and coming talents, all of which contribute to the artistic and cultured atmosphere. Its a great place to sit in, have a drink and a good chat!</p>
</li>
<li>
  <h4>The Brazen Head, 20 Lower Bridge St.</h4>
  <p>Around the corner from Christ Church you’ll find The Brazen Head, a pub that proudly boasts its status as Dublin’s oldest. Established in 1198 its difficult to ascertain how much of the original building is intact, however over the years its been added to and refurbished to provide a modern and effective service while still also retaining the character of its historical charm. If you’re interested in traditional or historical Irish pubs then this should be your first port of call.</p>
</li>
<li>
  <h4>The Bernard Shaw, 11-12 Richmond Place, Portobello</h4>
<p>Selling itself as a Pub, Cafe and Creative space, The Bernard Shaw is a funky joint to while away an hour or two, particularly in the early evening. Primarily decorated with murals from Street Artists such as Maser and No!dea, this haunt has a unique and buzzy vibe. From the initial “old man bar” impression when you get in the front door, you move through into a faux rough hewn back room replete with photography and art lining the walls. From there you can make your way into the back garden which has game tables and a bus from which Pizza is cooked and sold in the evenings. A fantastic place to check out.</p>
</li>
<li>
  <h4>The George, South Great Georges St.</h4>
  <p>This pub-slash-club has been the cornerstone and the foundation of the Dublin Gay scene from the earliest days, long before homosexuality was decriminalised in Ireland. The George features two bar areas; the front bar affectionately known as ‘Bridies&#8217; after one of the bar&#8217;s longest serving staff members; with its low lighting and velvet clad barstools is the perfect spot for a quiet drink and a chat. The main club venue has been graced by the presence of some of the hottest international acts including Alexandra Burke, Daniel Johnson, The Saturdays and Bananarama. Always a fantastic night out!</p>
</li>
</ul>
