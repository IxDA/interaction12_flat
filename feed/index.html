				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Redux events bring Interaction conference talks and ideas back to the local IxDA groups so that the inspiration and knowledge from the conference can reach as many people as possible. In the past, cities have organized these redux events themselves. This year, the Interaction12 committee wants to support these events and make an even bigger impact on local IxDA communities around the world.</p>

<p>Our goal is to attain a standardized and scalable mini-conference model that’s easily deployable, adaptable to local groups worldwide and is clearly and closely connected to the Interaction12 conference experience. We&#8217;re excited to announce the cities that are currently participating and planning to host a redux event in their city:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Atlanta, USA</li>
  <li>Chicago, USA</li>
  <li>Los Angeles, USA</li>
  <li>New York City, USA</li>
  <li>Portland, USA</li>
  <li>São Paulo, Brazil</li>
  <li>Sydney, Australia</li>
  <li>Taipei, Taiwan</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a list of cities that are currently planning redux events, but it&#8217;s our hope that many more cities will get involved and organize their own redux events. Over the past year we&#8217;ve been working with local leaders to create documentation that will help interested cities to create the best redux event possible. We&#8217;ve started a <a href="/redux" title="Interaction12 Redux">redux section</a> on the Interaction12 site, and will be updating it after Interaction12.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Want to know where the local go to eat? We've compiled a list of of places for almost every forseeable food situation, including the post pub-crawl munchies. <a href="http://interaction12.ixda.org/home/blog/the-foodies-guide-to-dublin/" class="read-more">Read more</a>]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So after seeing some tweets (well two, to be exact) asking for food recommendations, I decided to put a little blog together on my favourite food spots in Dublin.</p> 

<p>If there&#8217;s a category I didn&#8217;t get to, just find me or tweet me <a href="http://twitter.com/coryannj" target="_blank">@coryannj</a>. Happy eating!</p>

<h4>Important &#8211; how the location info works</h4>
<p>Actual address information is pretty unwieldy, so instead each place has an area name &#8211; you&#8217;ll then need to rely on old google for the details.</p>

<p>The area names are borrowed from this image &#8211; apologies in advance as it may hurt your eyes:</p>
<br />
<a href="http://interaction12.ixda.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/dublinareas.png"><img src="http://interaction12.ixda.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/dublinareas.png" alt="" title="dublinareas" width="398" height="400" align="center" /></a>
<br />
<p>As you can expect it&#8217;s not totally accurate &#8211; but will give you a sense of where you need to go.</p>

<h4>That annoying place that fits in every category</h4>
<p><strong>Fallon and Byrne</strong> (Georges St &#8211; <a href="http://fallonandbyrne.com" title="Fallon and Byrne" target="_blank">fallonandbyrne.com</a>) &#8211; It&#8217;s a foodhall, deli, coffee bar, wine bar, and restaurant &#8211; just go.</p>

<h4>Coffee</h4>
<p><strong>3fe</strong> (Capel St &#038; Docklands South &#8211; <a href="http://3fe.com" title="3fe coffee" target="_blank">3fe.com</a>) &#8211; The place to go if you weigh and grind your coffee before making it in your Aeropress.</p>

<p><strong>Bald Barista</strong> (Camden St &#8211; <a href="http://thebaldbarista.com" title="The Bald Barista" target="_blank">thebaldbarista.com</a>) &#8211; Owned by a Kiwi (don&#8217;t let that turn you off*). Also stocks amazing pies and food from The Gallic Kitchen.</p>

<p><strong>Clement and Pekoe</strong> (Grafton St &#8211; <a href="http://clementandpekoe.com" title="Clement and Pekoe teas and coffee" target="_blank">clementandpekoe.com</a>) &#8211; The type of place I&#8217;d expect to find the phrase &#8220;purveyors of tea&#8221; on the menu &#8211; but great coffee too.</p>

<h4>Gastropubs</h4>
<p><strong>The Exchequer</strong> (Georges St &#8211; <a href="http://theexchequer.ie" title="The Exchequer Gastropub" target="_blank">theexchequer.ie</a>) &#8211; Long beer list, more classy than casual pub grub and roast to order every Sunday.</p>

<p><strong>Against the Grain</strong> (Camden St) &#8211; Specialises in craft beers and hearty food.</p>

<p><strong>L. Mulligan Grocer</strong> (Stonybatter &#8211; <a href="http://lmulligangrocer.com" title="L. Mulligan Grocer" target="_blank">lmulligangrocer.com</a>) &#8211; Slightly outside the city centre (7 euro taxi ride) but great range of beers and the type of menu someone has put a lot of love into.</p>

<p><strong>Bull and Castle</strong> (Christchurch &#8211; <a href="http://bullandcastle.ie" title="Bull and Castle pub" target="_blank">bullandcastle.ie</a>) &#8211; Bit less gastro, more pub, but decent pub food upstairs and a restaurant downstairs.</p>

<h4>Hole in the wall</h4>
<p><strong>Bottega Toffoli</strong> (Christchurch) &#8211; If you can find it and get a seat (fits 12-ish max), it&#8217;s the best pizza in Dublin.</p>

<h4>Japanese</h4>
<p><strong>Kokoro</strong> (Capel St &#8211; <a href="http://kokorosushibento.com" title="Kokoro sushi" target="_blank">kokorosushibento.com</a>) &#8211; More take-away than sit down, but dazzling array of sushi as well as hot food.</p>

<p><strong>Yamamori</strong> (Capel St &#038; Georges St &#8211; <a href="http://yamamori.ie" title="Yamamori sushi" target="_blank">yamamori.ie</a>) &#8211; More sit down than take-away, with decent enough sushi.</p>

<h4>Asian</h4>
<p><strong>Hop House</strong> (O&#8217;Connell St &#8211; <a href="http://hophouse.ie" title="Hop House kim chi" target="_blank">hophouse.ie</a>) &#8211; Mostly Korean, with a doorbell on each table for service and an interconnecting reggae/sports bar next door (seriously).</p>

<p><strong>Hi lan</strong> (Capel St) &#8211; Bit of a mish mash with korean bbq, hotpot and mainstay korean/chinese dishes. Also spend €100 get free karaoke!</p>

<p><strong>M&#038;L Szechuan</strong> (O&#8217;Connell St) &#8211; Secret chinese menu, €2.50 beers &#8211; go!</p>

<p><strong>Good World</strong> (Georges St) &#8211; Smaller secret chinese menu, good for a sit down meal, open late.</p>

<h4>Cafe-type places</h4>
<p><strong>The Cake Cafe</strong> (Camden St &#8211; <a href="http://thecakecafe.ie" title="The Cake Cafe" target="_blank">thecakecafe.ie</a>) &#8211; Located behind the Daintree paper shop, it&#8217;s all freshly-baked sweet and savoury goodies.</p>

<p><strong>The Pepperpot</strong> (Grafton St &#8211; <a href="http://thepepperpot.ie" title="The Pepperpot" target="_blank">thepepperpot.ie</a>) &#8211; Sister of the Cake Cafe, more centrally located with equally yummy food.</p>

<p><strong>Eastwood and Mays</strong> (Georges St &#8211; <a href="http://eastwoodandmays.com" title="Eastwood and Mays cafe" target="_blank">eastwoodandmays.com</a>) &#8211; New-ish cafe doing lunch and dinner, great food including a Secret Dinner for €12.95 with glass of wine, and named after pugs!</p>

<h4>Vegetarian/Vegan</h4>
<strong>Cornucopia</strong> (Grafton St &#8211; <a href="http://cornucopia.ie" title="Cornucopia wholefoods" target="_blank">cornucopia.ie</a>) &#8211; Open from early till late with the best vegetarian/vegan food in Dublin.</p>

<p><strong>Blazing Salads</strong> (Grafton St &#8211; <a href="http://blazingsalads.com" title="Blazing Salads" target="_blank">blazingsalads.com</a>) &#8211; Mostly for the lunch crowd, salads, soups, hot food and baked things.</p>

<h4>Bistro-y</h4>
<p><strong>Green Hen</strong> (Grafton St &#8211; <a href="http://greenhen.ie" title="The Green Hen" target="_blank">greenhen.ie</a>) &#8211; Tough to get a booking but worth it if you can.</p>

<p><strong>The Pig&#8217;s Ear</strong> (Trinity College &#8211; <a href="http://thepigsear.ie" title="The Pig's Ear restaurant" target="_blank">thepigsear.ie</a>) &#8211; Beautiful food that&#8217;s also seriously nyom, Irish with a twist.</p>

<p><strong>Coppinger Row</strong> (Grafton St &#8211; <a href="http://coppingerrow.com" title="Coppinger Row" target="_blank">coppingerrow.com</a>) &#8211; Has the best cocktails in Dublin to go along with the mediterranean-style food.</p>

<p><strong>The Winding Stair</strong> (Capel St &#8211; <a href="http://www.winding-stair.com" title="The Winding Stair" target="_blank">winding-stair.com</a>) &#8211; Bookstore downstairs, restaurant upstairs, with hearty, warming food and a great early bird menu.</p>

<h4>Fancy places you probably won&#8217;t get a booking in</h4>
<p><strong>Pichet</strong> (Grafton St &#8211; <a href="http://pichet-restaurant.com" title="Pichet" target="_blank">pichet-restaurant.com</a>) &#8211; Famous for its quirky blue bucket chairs and brilliant french food.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter One</strong> (O&#8217;Connell St &#8211; <a href="http://chapteronerestaurant.com" title="Chapter One" target="_blank">chapteronerestaurant.com</a>) &#8211; Brilliant food and equally brilliant service without the stuffiness.</p>

<p><strong>Thorntons</strong> (Stephens Green &#8211; <a href="http://thorntonsrestaurant.com" title="Thorntons Restaurant" target="_blank">thorntonsrestaurant.com</a>) &#8211; The place for &#8216;wow&#8217; looking food, but for taste you can probably do better&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Patrick Guilbauds</strong> (Merrion &#8211; <a href="http://restaurantpatrickguilbaud.ie" title="Restaurant Patrick Guibaud" target="_blank">restaurantpatrickguilbaud.ie</a>) &#8211; You know, the one with *that* star.</p>

<h4>When you stumble out of a pub at 3am</h4>
<p><strong>Zaytoon</strong> (Temple Bar &#038; Camden &#8211; <a href="http://zaytoon.ie" title="Zaytoon" target="_blank">zaytoon.ie</a>) &#8211; Best kebabs in Dublin.</p>
<p><strong>Rick&#8217;s Burgers</strong> (Georges St) &#8211; You get a spoon and fork with your burger, that should tell you everything.</p>
<p><strong>Iskanders</strong> (Georges St) &#8211; Second best kebabs in Dublin.</p>
<p>*I&#8217;m Australian, just fulfilling my obligatory Kiwi joke quota.</p>]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&rsquo;re all interaction designers here, so we can be honest with one another&hellip; Diagramming, layout, and image editing tools are becoming increasingly difficult to use to describe the behaviors of the systems we design. Better technology, new interaction models, and more experienced users allow and even require us to refine and describe this behavior at a much more intricate level. These new opportunities also give us new and spectacular ways to fail. Prototyping has become an essential part of effective interaction design for this new world. Fortunately, new tools have evolved to help designers prototype easily.</p>

<p>Axure is one of the big guns. Because it can do so much it can also be intimidating to learn. But if you&rsquo;re an Interaction12 attendee, you&rsquo;re in luck (well, in MORE luck&hellip; you&rsquo;re already going to an awesome conference)! I&rsquo;ve been using Axure since 2005, teaching it since 2007, and I&rsquo;ll be giving a free (as in TOTALLY FREE!) <a href="http://interaction12.ixda.org/programme/#session-506" title="Axure for Newbies: An Intro to Prototyping in Axure RP">three-hour introductory workshop</a> on Wednesday, February 1 at 1:30pm! If you&rsquo;ve ever wanted to learn it, now&rsquo;s your chance.</p>

<p>Now, I won&rsquo;t be able to cover everything (that takes two and-a-half days), but I will cover a few big topics. First I&rsquo;ll introduce you to Axure&rsquo;s basic concepts and orient you to its user interface. Next we&rsquo;ll talk about wireframing in Axure. This includes setting up grids and page formatting, laying out and formatting wireframe elements, and using a feature called Masters to make you efficient. You will, of course, be building your own wireframe as you go. In the next section you&rsquo;ll make it interactive. You&rsquo;ll make it do simple things like linking to pages and slick new things like on-page tabs and dynamically adding items to a list.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that this workshop is for absolute Axure beginners. If you&rsquo;ve been using Axure for some time and you want to do stuff that is <strong>Really Awesome</strong>, I encourage you to sign up for my other workshop. <a href="http://interaction12.ixda.org/speakers/bios/#Jeff-Harrison">Jeff Harrison</a> and I are co-presenting <a href="http://interaction12.ixda.org/programme/#session-379" title="Prototyping Native Mobile Apps in Axure">Prototyping Native Mobile Apps in Axure</a>, in which you&rsquo;ll learn how to prototype native mobile apps that even enjoy limited gesture support on mobile devices.</p>

<p>See you in Dublin!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whew! Our wonderful <a href="http://interaction12.ixda.org/student-challenge/#judges">judges</a> have sifted through the 56 entries! We heard from a number of judges how impressed they were overall with the quality of the entries and the creativity and passion that the group overall had to offer. Of course, this makes the selection process a difficult one. We&#8217;ve thought to ourselves &#8220;Well, what if we could take them ALL!!!&#8221; but of course, we can&#8217;t.</p>

<p>We managed to find four wonderful and inspiring entries among all the bounty of goodness we received from around the world. Look after the jump for their entries, and our winners are (in no particular order)</p>

<p>This year IxDA launched an important and ambitious new program: the inaugural <a href="http://awards.ixda.org/" target="_blank">Interaction Awards</a>, sponsored by <a href="http://awards.ixda.org/sponsor/" target="_blank">Google</a>, and celebrated at this year’s Interaction12 Conference in Dublin. We created the awards to celebrate excellence in our field, and to encourage the global interaction design community to share our work. The excitement for this kind of exposure is palpable. We received over 300 entries from across 33 countries for the 2012 Awards.</p>

<p>The awards, open to any professional or student projects completed within the past two years, started with an initial evaluation of the work across the criteria of context, impact and craft. An international panel of peer reviewers chose the top 72 projects for the <a href="http://www.ixda.org/node/31304" target="_blank">Shortlist</a> of entries that were then presented and reviewed by our carefully selected Awards <a href="http://awards.ixda.org/jury/ " target="_blank">Jury</a>.</p>

<figure><img src="http://interaction12.ixda.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_3244.jpg" alt="The Interaction Design Awards Jurors" title="The Interaction Design Awards Jurors" width="480" height="270" class="size-full" /></figure>

<p>The Jury review, led by Jury Chair Robert Fabricant of New York, USA, took place over 2 days in New York City last month, was comprised of high-profile designers and thinkers from around the globe including: Massimo Banzi (Milan, Italy), Janna DeVylder (Sydney, Australia), Matt Jones (London, UK), Younghee Jung (Bangalore, India), Jonas Löwgren (Malmo, Sweden), and Helen Walters (New York, USA).</p>

<p>These esteemed jurors were chosen for their experience, domain expertise and strong opinions on good design. And they didn’t disappoint. Over long days of intense discussion and debate, they evaluated essays, interrogated prototypes, and reviewed entrant’s videos representing each design project. Push pins and post-its strewn the room as they compared the contexts, impact and craft behind products and services as diverse as in-car dashboards, installations, and wayfinding systems and games. Daunting as it may sound, they expertly narrowed the 72 shortlisted projects to 26 finalists, and then chose top honors in each category and overall.</p>

<figure><img src="http://interaction12.ixda.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_3239.jpg" alt="The Interaction Design Awards Jurors" title="The Interaction Design Awards Jurors" width="480" height="270" class="size-full" /></figure>

<p>The Finalists <a href="http://www.ixda.org/node/31595" target="_blank">just announced on ixda.org</a> will be awarded honors in 6 interaction categories: Optimizing, engaging, empowering, expressing, connecting, disrupting. Interaction categories? We deliberated about these categories. Platforms, industries and domains say very little about what we actually do. For a while we considered having no categories at all, but we opted for categories that would challenge us to think about the intentions of the work and the nature of the interactions IxDA creates, and how these sit across platforms, domains, and cultures.</p>
	
<p>Later this month, we’ll launch an online gallery of all shortlisted projects and open voting for the People’s Choice of best project for the year. This award empowers the community to take part in the process and engage in constructive conversation about the best representations of our growing field for 2012. At the awards ceremony, at 8:00 p.m. on February 3, 2012 in Dublin, we will honor the 26 finalists, and award the prizes for top honors in each category, as well as an overall winner for the year. We hope the conversation started &#8211; by the awards, in the online gallery, at the ceremony &#8211; will extend far beyond February’s celebration of interaction design. Our ultimate goal is for the Interaction Awards to start a dialogue, inspire designers and businesses alike, raise the profile of interaction design, and demonstrate its value in the global economy. </p>

<p>This is an exciting time for our field, and we’re thrilled about the impact the awards will have as a showcase and demonstration of the breadth and depth of design excellence to be found across our diverse community. Check out the online gallery (when it launches), come to the party, and enter next year’s awards, opening in June 2012. </p>

<p><em>The Interaction Awards take place on Friday the 3rd of February 2012 in Dublin. Entry to the Interaction Awards is included as part of the Interaction12 conference package. <a href="http://interaction12.ixda.org/register/">Register for Interaction12</a></em></p>
